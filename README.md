# Lionhearts-Discord-Bot
This is the stable build version from January of 2021 I designed alone, however since then there have been additions to the source code by other developers at Credenzio Studios.

Purpose of the Bot:
1. Give players access to public information without having to start the game (i.e. Territory Ownership, Currently Active Battles)
2. Allow players to access personal information related to their character without having to enter the game
3. Give discord roles to players related to their faction of choice in the game
4. Allow for expandability into moderation, new commands, new roles, etc
